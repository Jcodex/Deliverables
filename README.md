# Deliverables

1. Set up a virtual Linux-based environment with Vagrant.
  
I am using hashicorp/bionic64 image for virtual machine

command "vagrant up" is creating configuring and strating up my virtual machine

in vagrantfile described configuration and how to provision machine

Jenkins configuration (via copy paste jobs), Ansible installation and executing playbook is managed by mysetup.sh 

2. Take a Java application source code: you may want to get JSudoku or any other freeware.

Code downloaded from https://sourceforge.net/projects/jsudoku/files/jSudoku/jSudoku-1.3/jSudoku-src-1.3.tar.gz/download
  
3. Create a GitHub repository and push the source code to it.

I create 2 GitHub repositories to provide 2 solutions for the task

First Solution:

https://github.com/Jcodex/devopstask

I pushed both source code and all nedded to Jenkins job and ant files in "devopstask, in order to git clone it later with Jenkins and build app. It's doesn't match requirement which says that source code must be downloaded by ant, but it feel more convinient to me and provide build.xml file to other users.

https://github.com/Jcodex/devopsant

I pushed only source code to "devopsant" repository
  
4. Prepare Apache Ant build file build.xml

build.xml consist of following targets:

  download - downloading code from repo
  
  checkstyle - checking code in all .java files
  
  compile - compiling project
  
  jar - creating jar file

5. Set up Jenkins job to build JSudoku using the build.xml build file.

"First Job" clone my git repository then invoke ant and execute consistently "checkstyle", "compile", "jar" targets
In order to invoke ant targets, build.xml was also pushed in git repository as well as checkstyle-8.29-all.jar and sun_checks.xml

"Second Job" execute consistently following
  
6. Enhance the job by adding the code testing stage with Checkstyle or PMD.

As a post-build action Jenkins publish checkstyle_errors.xml
